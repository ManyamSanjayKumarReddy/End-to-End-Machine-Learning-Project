## Exception.py File Explanation 



The provided code demonstrates an error handling mechanism and defines a custom exception class.

The `error_message_details` function takes an `error` and `error_detail` as parameters. It uses the `exc_info()` method from the `sys` module to retrieve information about the error, including the traceback. It extracts the file name and line number where the error occurred. It then creates an error message string using the retrieved information, the error message itself, and the line number. Finally, it returns the error message.

The `CustomException` class is a subclass of the built-in `Exception` class. It has an `__init__` method that initializes the exception by calling the `__init__` method of the parent class with the provided `error_message`. Additionally, it uses the `error_message_details` function to generate a detailed error message and stores it in the `self.error_message` attribute.

The class also has a `__str__` method that is automatically called when the instance is converted to a string. It returns the stored error message.

This error handling mechanism allows you to raise custom exceptions and provide detailed error messages, including the file name and line number where the exception occurred. It can be useful for debugging and providing more meaningful error information to users or developers.
